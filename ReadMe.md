I chose to pull the Citibike data from 2016 right around the November election.

# Analysis

With us just passing a fresh election day, I decided to focus on the period surrounding the 2016 election(11/8/2016) in the US to see if there was any demographic changes in how the Citibike system was used during that time. If I had more time, I would have also made the same charts for the current election cycle.

By comparing the starting rental location with weekday usage, I saw a general decline as November passed. On the election day, there was a noticeable decrease in usage. These graphs are filterable by the week to see trends.

I also wanted to look and see if gender played a role in station usage. I determined the gender of each user (discarding the unknown users) and then calculated the users for each day of the month. Interestingly when comparing the Tuesday of the election to the precious Tuesday there was a slight decline in the peaks for the day even though overall there was a slightly higher overall usage for the day. This could suggest that people were changing the commuting times to fit around voting on the day, which flattened the overall peaks for the day. This is supported by the fact that the inclines for both genders aren't as steep as the previous tuesday for both the start and end of the work day. Again, you can filter this data by each group for more information.

I also wanted to compare age usage for this same period. I broke the users into generation groups and customer type. This information was overlaid on a map of the most recent to 2016 per capita income info from the US census. As expected, the more recent generations are higher user numbers since they are more likely to adapt to new trends/tech. You also see that these groups congregate in the lower income areas since they have had less earning time. The start location was used as this is more likely to provide information where the user lives rather than their destination. This information also showed Gen X users were more active on election day. This is as expected as their generation is likely to use new tech and their age group tends to vote more than younger generations. Again, this map is filterable by generation group, etc.
